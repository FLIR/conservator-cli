Advanced Python API Guide
=========================

This page assumes you already have Conservator CLI installed.  If you do not,
follow the :doc:`installation` instructions first.

This guide will discuss more of the underlying tech in Conservator CLI. If you're
just getting started, take a look at the :doc:`api_quickstart`, or check out
`/examples`.

GraphQL and SGQLC
-----------------

Conservator uses GraphQL. GraphQL is very useful in that it lets
an API call specify what information it is interested in. For instance, if you
want a list of all of the names of the `Projects` on Conservator, you don't
need to also be sent the `metadata`, `file urls`, etc--You can just request the
`name` field.

Another feature of GraphQL is introspection, which lets you discover all
available API calls and types using other API calls. SGQLC is a Python library
that can automatically generated a Python API wrapper, autogenerated from these
introspective API calls.

Conservator CLI is built on top of an autogenerated SGQLC API.  This API is
available in :mod:`FLIR.conservator.generated.schema` and can be used for
any query.
