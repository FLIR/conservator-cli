Installation
============

*TODO*

The best way to install ``conservator-cli`` is with ``pip``::

    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/FLIR/conservator-cli@main

You can also add the package to your ``requirements.txt``::

    ...
    requests
    eventlet
    -e git+ssh://git@github.com/FLIR/conservator-cli@main
    ...

If you're developing ``conservator-cli``, you should clone the
repository, create a fresh ``venv``, and run ``pip install .`` to install dependencies.
