Welcome to Conservator CLI's documentation!
===========================================

At its core, Conservator CLI is a Python library built to interface with Conservator.
It also provides a nice CLI on top of the library.

Internally, Conservator CLI uses `sgqlc`_ to generate a Python API for Conservator. It
then provides several layers of abstraction on top of this, to make operations
as simple and easy as possible.

To get started, see the :doc:`usage/installation` guide.  Then, get an overview using
the :doc:`usage/cli_quickstart` or :doc:`usage/api_quickstart`.
